So as per the challenge name you can gues easily that the challenge is something about web page cookies.So i saw the webpage cookie with name "flag" and the content in it was "bc54f4d60f1cec0f9a6cb70e13f2127a".So if you are a regular CTF participant you can easily see it is a hash and decoding the hash on crackstation.com i got to knew that it is hash for "pc" which is the starting of the flag.So i made a script to get all the cookies and decoded it one by one in python.

After decoding i got the flag	:	
	
	pctf{c0oki3s_@re_yUm_bUt_tHEy_@ls0_r3vEaL_@_l0t}
